# JARS - A React & React Native framework for speedy development
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome to JARS - a microframework for building production ready React and React Native apps.

The React library and its supporting ecosystems have been through tectonic shifts in the past couple of years. Hence, starting a new React project involves a lot of research and decision making. The JARS project does all this work for you, and lets you focus on what matters, writing great applications!

JARS has been written with the following goals in mind:
- Output high quality web and mobile applications with modular code
- Mitigate cognitive load on developers by reducing the amount of decisions to be made and working memory needed
- Make it easy for developers to seamlessly jump between Web and Mobile application programming
- Provide commonly needed utilities to speed up development
